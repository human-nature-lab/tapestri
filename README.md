# Overview
`northNomad/tapestri` is forked from `missionbio/tapestriR`, an R package for DNA and DNA + Protein analysis of data generated by the Tapestri platform.
For additional documentation and tutorials visit: https://missionbio.github.io/tapestriR/

Missionbio no longer maintains the tapestriR package. 
The `northNomad/tapestri` will serve the purpose of storing functions I write for a project.
